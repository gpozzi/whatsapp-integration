## 2026-01-06 - [Timing Attack Prevention in API Key Validation]
**Vulnerability:** The API key verification in `ingestor.py` used a standard string comparison (`!=`). This allows an attacker to infer the API key character by character by measuring the time it takes for the comparison to fail.
**Learning:** Even in high-level languages like Python, simple equality checks for secrets can introduce timing side channels.
**Prevention:** Always use `secrets.compare_digest()` (or equivalent constant-time comparison functions) when validating API keys, tokens, or passwords.
